## Core Technology Stack (2025)

### Current Versions (Updated via Web Research)

- **Elixir**: 1.19+ (with enhanced type system and pretty printing improvements)
- **Phoenix**: 1.7.21 (stable)
- **Phoenix LiveView**: 1.1.2 (with colocated hooks, keyed comprehensions, TypeScript support)
- **Ecto**: 3.13.2 (with improved changesets and CTE operations)

### Recommended Stack

- **Language**: Elixir (including OTP patterns)
- **Web Framework**: Phoenix (including LiveView & Channels)
- **Data Layer**: Ecto with SQLite3 (`ecto_sqlite3`) for lightweight apps, PostgreSQL for scale
- **APIs**: REST-first with Phoenix controllers
- **Deployment**: Modern release practices on Ubuntu/Linux with Caddy reverse proxy
- **Monitoring**: Telemetry integration for observability and performance optimization

---

## Core Principles & Ground Rules

### 1. Code Philosophy

- **Clarity over cleverness** - Favor readable, maintainable code over obscure optimizations
- **Elixir-first bias** - Use Phoenix, LiveView, OTP (GenServers), and Ecto defaults before introducing dependencies
- **Performance mindset** - Design for fast rendering and minimal memory usage using LiveComponent isolation, streams, temporary assigns, and telemetry metrics
- **Fault tolerance** - Embrace "let it crash" philosophy with proper supervision trees

### 2. Development Constraints

- **NO AUTOMATIC TESTING** - Never create comprehensive test suites, testing frameworks, or test files unless explicitly requested by the user
- **TEMPORARY TESTING ONLY** - Only create minimal, temporary tests during development if absolutely necessary for verification, then remove them
- **NO GIT INTERACTION** - Never interact with Git (commits, branches, pushes) unless explicitly instructed by the user
- **ESCALATE AMBIGUITY** - When facing unclear requirements around data migrations, security, or refactors, pause and seek input

### 3. Architecture Decisions

- **Think architecturally** - Propose robust solutions using Phoenix Contexts and OTP principles
- **Domain-driven organization** - Clear module naming (e.g., `Accounts`, `Bookings`, `Posts`)
- **Thin controllers/LiveViews** - Keep business logic in contexts
- **Use GenServer sparingly** - Only when you need mutable shared state or external processes

---

## Modern Frontend Approach (LiveView 1.1.2+)

### Core LiveView Patterns

- **Phoenix HEEx Templates + LiveView** - Build interactivity with minimal JavaScript using `phx-hook` or `Phoenix.LiveView.JS`
- **Colocated Hooks** (New in 1.1) - Write JavaScript hooks directly next to HEEx components with `<script :type={Phoenix.LiveView.ColocatedHook}>`
- **LiveView Streams** - Use `stream/4`, `stream_insert/4`, `stream_delete/3` for scalable lists without retaining state in memory
- **Temporary Assigns** - Clear large assigns after render for memory efficiency
- **LiveComponent Isolation** - Scope updates to prevent full-page re-renders

### LiveView Best Practices

```elixir
# Use keyed comprehensions for better change tracking (1.1+)
<div :for={{id, item} <- @streams.items} id={id}>
  <%= item.name %>
</div>

# Colocated hooks for component-specific JavaScript
<div id="sortable" phx-hook=".Sortable">
  <!-- content -->
</div>

<script :type={Phoenix.LiveView.ColocatedHook} name=".Sortable">
  // JavaScript here, automatically namespaced
</script>
```

### Asset Strategy

- **Plain CSS** - Scoped per component using modern CSS (Flexbox, Grid)
- **TailwindCSS with DaisyUI** (Phoenix 1.8+) - For component theming and dark mode support
- **Minimal JavaScript** - Leverage Phoenix.LiveView.JS for most interactions

---

## Backend Architecture (Phoenix 1.7+/1.8)

### Phoenix Framework Features

- **Verified Routes** - Use `~p` for compile-time route verification
- **Magic Link Authentication** (1.8+) - Built into `phx.gen.auth` generator
- **Unified Developer Experience** - Single approach for both traditional and real-time apps

### Database & Ecto (3.13.2+)

- **Ecto Changesets** - Use everywhere for validation (improved in 3.13+)
- **Query Optimization** - Always `preload` associations to avoid N+1 queries
- **SQLite3 Optimization** - Use `mode: :immediate` for better concurrency
- **Security** - Never interpolate user input; use Ecto parameterization

### Modern Ecto Patterns

```elixir
# Improved changeset functions (3.13+)
def changeset(user, attrs) do
  user
  |> cast(attrs, [:name, :email])
  |> validate_required([:name, :email])
  |> validate_email(:email)
  |> unique_constraint(:email)
end

# CTE operations support (3.13+)
query = from u in User, where: u.active == true
Repo.all(User |> with_cte("active_users", as: ^query, operation: :update))
```

## Security & Performance Standards

### Security Requirements

- **Input Validation** - Dual-layer validation (changeset + custom logic)
- **XSS Prevention** - Never use `raw/1` or `dangerously_set_inner_html`
- **SQL Injection** - Always use Ecto parameterization
- **Security Scanning** - Run `mix sobelow --config` for vulnerability checks

### Performance Optimization

- **LiveView Streams** - For large collections without server memory retention
- **PubSub over Polling** - Use Phoenix.PubSub for real-time updates
- **Asset Optimization** - `mix assets.deploy` for production builds
- **Database Indexing** - Index frequently queried fields
- **Telemetry Metrics** - Performance optimization with telemetry integration for monitoring and observability

---

## Quality Assurance Workflow

### Required Checks (No Testing)

1. **Code Formatting** - `mix format --check-formatted`
2. **Linting** - `mix credo --strict` for code quality
3. **Type Analysis** - `mix dialyzer` for static analysis (leverage Elixir 1.18 improvements)
4. **Security Scanning** - `mix sobelow --config` for vulnerabilities
5. **Compilation** - `mix compile --warnings-as-errors`

### Documentation Standards

- Use `@doc` on complex public functions with realistic examples
- Maintain `README.md` with setup steps and environment variables
- Write `CHANGELOG.md` for breaking changes
- Explain architectural decisions in module documentation

---

## Development Interaction Guidelines

### Opening Protocol

When starting any Elixir/Phoenix work, always:

1. Acknowledge the latest technology versions researched
2. Ask clarifying questions about project goals and architecture
3. Propose solutions using Phoenix Contexts and OTP patterns
4. Explain the "why" behind every code decision

### Code Generation Standards

When providing code solutions, include:

- Phoenix controller/LiveView implementation
- Context module with business logic
- Ecto schema with proper validations
- Telemetry integration for monitoring and observability
- Necessary configuration changes
- **NO TEST FILES** (unless explicitly requested)

### Problem-Solving Approach

1. **Understand Requirements** - Ask questions to clarify goals
2. **Design Architecture** - Propose fault-tolerant, maintainable solutions
3. **Implement Incrementally** - Build features step by step
4. **Optimize Performance** - Use streams, preloading, efficient patterns, and telemetry metrics
5. **Ensure Security** - Apply validation and security best practices

- Heavy JavaScript when LiveView can handle it
- Not using LiveComponent isolation for complex UIs

### Database Anti-Patterns

- N+1 queries (always preload associations)
- Missing indexes on frequently queried fields
- Direct SQL interpolation (security risk)
- Not using changesets for validation

### Architecture Anti-Patterns

- Business logic in controllers/LiveViews
- Tight coupling between contexts
- Not using supervision trees properly
- Over-engineering simple solutions

---

## Summary: Excellence Standards

| Principle | Implementation |
|-----------|----------------|
| **Maintainable Code** | Phoenix conventions, clear contexts, documented functions |
| **Real-time Performance** | LiveView + streams + temporary assigns + PubSub |
| **Security First** | Ecto validation, Sobelow scanning, input sanitization |
| **Developer Experience** | Fast compilation, clear errors, minimal configuration |
| **Production Ready** | Supervision trees, proper releases, monitoring hooks |

---

**Remember**: Focus on shipping clean, performant, and secure Elixir applications. Avoid comprehensive testing unless explicitly requested. Never interact with Git unless instructed. Always explain architectural decisions and prioritize maintainability over clever solutions.

## Git Commit Message Protocol
